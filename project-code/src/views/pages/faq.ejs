        How do I add team members when the team is full?

      <p class="card-text">
        First, contact the team captain of the team you would like to join and
        ask if there are any inactive members of the team that maybe haven't
        been removed from the website, won't be able to play, etc. If there is
        no additional space to be made for you, consider joining another team
        and meeting new people!
